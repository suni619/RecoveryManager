RecoveryManager
===============

Recovery manager is a Java project which simulates the working of DBMS recovery manager. The project recovers the DBMS to a consistent state whenever a failure is occurred. It uses the checkpoint information to redo the operations if they are committed after the checkpoint or undo the operations that are not committed.
